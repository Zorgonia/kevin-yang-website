An Android app that allows users to look at the cards released in the last [Shadowverse](https://shadowverse.com/) expansion and rate them. Users can use any of the languages available on [Shadowverse Portal](https://shadowverse-portal.com/), as well as create deck links on the portal from deckcodes. 

Developed in **Kotlin** for Android. Used MVVM, REST, and Single Activity Pattern. Worked on during January 2021.
