An online store that allows users to sign up, add items to their cart, and purchase items from a store. 

Developed in a team of 4 developers, including myself. Developed with **React** using Express, **NodeJS**, and **MongoDB**. Worked on from February 2020 to April 2020. I worked on the front end for the login and sign-up pages, as well as the REST API calls related to checkout.
