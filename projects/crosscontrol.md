A 2.5D Action game where you're a robot trying to escape the mind with conflicting controls. Can you leverage your partners to make your way through the labryinth? 

Developed by a team of 3 developers (including myself), 2 artists, and 2 musicians. Developed in **Unity**. Worked on implementing player abilties, designed some levels, implemented art/music assets, and fixed bugs. Worked on from September 2021 to December 2021.
